METHODOLOGY

The proposed methodology consists of the following steps:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Load MRI images and assign corresponding labels.
Apply preprocessing like resizing images to 224x224 pixels.
Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Perform data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) to prevent overfitting.

Model Development:

Build a CNN model with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
Fine-tune VGG16 and MobileNet using transfer learning.
Construct Hybrid CNN + LSTM architecture for sequence modeling of spatial features.

Model Training:

Use Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
Apply early stopping and model checkpoints.
Train on 70% of the dataset, validate on 20%, and test on 10%.

Evaluation:

Evaluate models on unseen data.
Calculate performance metrics.
Compare models based on evaluation results and computational efficiency.

Deployment:

Export the final model.
Integrate with a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) for real-world application.
This structured approach ensures thorough training, validation, and analysis of the implemented models.
