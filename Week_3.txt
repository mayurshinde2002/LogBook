LITERATURE REVIEW

Several studies have indicated the superiority of deep learning models
over traditional machine learning techniques in medical imaging tasks:

CNNs have been widely used for image classification tasks,
automatically learning hierarchical features from raw pixel data without manual feature engineering.

VGG16, a deep convolutional network, gained popularity due to its simplicity
and effectiveness in extracting high-level semantic features from images.

Hybrid CNN + LSTM architectures combine the spatial feature extraction
of CNNs with the temporal learning capabilities of LSTMs, enhancing model generalization on complex datasets.

MobileNet architectures focus on creating lightweight models suitable for 
mobile and embedded applications without significant compromises in accuracy.

Previous works have also shown that data augmentation, proper preprocessing,
and transfer learning significantly boost the performance of classification models in brain MRI image datasets.
