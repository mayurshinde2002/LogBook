IMPLEMENTATION OF SECOND MODULE (VGG16 MODEL)
The second model was based on Transfer Learning using the VGG16 architecture:

Process:

Loaded pre-trained VGG16 model with ImageNet weights.
Removed the top dense layers.
Added custom dense layers for our 4-class classification.
Used data augmentation during training for better generalization.

Training Details:

Frozen initial convolutional layers.
Trained only the fully connected layers and final convolutional blocks.
Optimizer: Adam with a lower learning rate (1e-4).

Results:

Achieved around 92-94% validation accuracy.
Less overfitting observed compared to the custom CNN model.
Fine-tuning further improved accuracy by 1-2%.
Thus, VGG16 proved to be a strong performer for MRI classification tasks.
