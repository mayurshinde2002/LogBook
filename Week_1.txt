INTRODUCTION

Brain tumors are among the most life-threatening types of cancers,
primarily due to the delicate location and critical functions associated with the human brain.
Early and accurate detection is crucial for improving survival rates and planning effective treatments.
Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on manual inspection of MRI images by skilled radiologists.
However, the increasing volume of medical imaging data and limited availability of specialists
necessitates the development of automated solutions.

This project, titled "Brain Tumour Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques", 
focuses on developing a robust machine learning system to classify brain MRI
images into four categories: Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor,
and No Tumor. The system utilizes four powerful models — CNN, VGG16, Hybrid CNN + LSTM,
and MobileNet — to explore and compare their effectiveness.

The significance of early brain tumor detection cannot be overstated,
 as it directly impacts patient prognosis and treatment planning.
  This project aims to bridge the gap between clinical diagnosis and
   AI-based assistance by delivering a reliable, accurate, and fast prediction system.
