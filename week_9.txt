IMPLEMENTATION OF THIRD MODULE (HYBRID CNN+LSTM and MobileNet)
In this phase, two models were developed and evaluated:

1. Hybrid CNN + LSTM Model:

Architecture:

CNN for spatial feature extraction
Flatten layer output fed into LSTM layers
Final dense layer for classification

Purpose:

To capture sequential patterns in feature maps, potentially improving performance.

Results:

Achieved around 90% validation accuracy.
Slightly better generalization compared to standalone CNN.

2. MobileNet Model:

Architecture:
Lightweight depthwise separable convolutions.

Purpose:

Enable fast and efficient model inference, suitable for mobile devices.

Results:

Achieved 88-90% validation accuracy.
Significantly reduced model size and inference time compared to VGG16.

Comparison and Final Selection:

Best Accuracy: VGG16 (~94%)
Best Lightweight Model: MobileNe
Best Hybrid Model: CNN + LSTM (for complex sequential patterns)
Thus, depending on application needs (high accuracy vs. lightweight deployment), suitable models can be selected.
