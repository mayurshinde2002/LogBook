IMPLEMENTATION OF FIRST MODULE (CNN MODEL)
The first model implemented was a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It included:

Architecture:

Input layer (224x224x3)
Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activatio
Max pooling layers to reduce dimensionality
Dense layers for classification
Softmax output layer

Training Details:

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Batch Size: 32

Epochs: 30
Early stopping after no improvement for 5 epochs

Results:

Achieved validation accuracy around 85-88% after hyperparameter tuning.
Model overfitting reduced significantly by using dropout layers (0.5).
The CNN served as a baseline for comparing more complex models.
