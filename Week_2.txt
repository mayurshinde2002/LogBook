PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVE OF WORK

Problem Statement:

Manual diagnosis of brain tumors through MRI analysis is a laborious task
requiring significant expertise. Misdiagnosis or delayed detection can lead to fatal outcomes.
The variability in tumor size, shape, and location further complicates the diagnostic process.



Objectives:

To develop a machine learning-based system capable of classifying MRI images into four tumor classes.
To implement and compare four models: CNN, VGG16, Hybrid CNN+LSTM, and MobileNet.
To apply effective data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
To evaluate models rigorously using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
To select the best-performing model suitable for real-world deployment.
The broader objective is to assist medical professionals, reduce diagnosis time, and improve overall diagnostic accuracy through AI-driven technology.
