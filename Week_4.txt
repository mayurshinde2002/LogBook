PROPOSED SYSTEM

The proposed system for Brain Tumour Detection is based on the application of various
deep learning models to automatically classify MRI brain images. Our aim is to build
a system that can assist radiologists by providing a second opinion and reducing diagnostic errors.

The system follows a structured pipeline:

Dataset Preparation:
We use a publicly available brain MRI dataset categorized into four classes:
Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. Each image is preprocessed to
enhance quality and resized to a uniform dimension to maintain consistency across inputs.

Data Preprocessing:
Preprocessing steps include normalization of pixel values,
data augmentation (rotation, zoom, horizontal flip), and denoising filters.
These techniques help in improving the robustness and generalization ability of models.

Model Architecture:

CNN Model: A custom-built CNN with multiple convolutional layers,
pooling layers, ReLU activation functions, batch normalization, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

VGG16 Model: Transfer learning approach using the pre-trained VGG16 model.
We freeze the early layers and fine-tune the deeper layers to adapt the model to the MRI dataset.

Hybrid CNN+LSTM Model: In this model, the CNN acts as a feature extractor,
and the extracted feature maps are passed through an LSTM network to learn complex sequential dependencies between features.

MobileNet Model: A lightweight, efficient model optimized for mobile and edge devices,
suitable for real-time diagnosis applications.

Training Phase:
Models are trained using categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer.
Early stopping and model checkpointing are employed to avoid overfitting and retain the best-performing model.

Testing and Validation:
The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets (typically 70-20-10 ratio).
Performance on the validation set is monitored during training to tune hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and optimizer type.

Evaluation Metrics:
Models are evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under Curve (AUC) scores are analyzed for better understanding of model performance.

Comparison and Analysis:
After training all models, we perform a detailed comparison based on evaluation metrics,
computational complexity, inference time, and memory consumption. This helps in selecting the best model for deployment.

Deployment Considerations:
The final system can be integrated into a user-friendly interface that allows
clinicians to upload MRI images and receive instant predictions along with probability scores for each class.
